# Data Structure and Algorithms Roadmap

## Step 1
Choose a programming language. `C++` is the ideal choice if one is using DSA for competitions as it is fast and verbose and omits the complications of `C`. 

> This tutorial series is based on `Python`, as this is ideal for `less code, more result` approach.

## Learn Basics
Before getting into algorithms, you should have a good grasp over the language itself. These are the basic prerequisits to learn first.
1. Data types
2. Basic Input/Output
3. Operators
4. Loops
5. Conditional Statements
6. Switch Statements
7. Functions
8. Libraries

## The Fun Part
Now that you have a good knowledge of the language, you are ready to use them in the application. Some important concepts are:

1. Array and Hashmaps
2. Strings
3. Two pointers
4. Sliding Window
5. Stacking
6. Linked List
7. Trees
8. Queue
9. Graphs
10. Backtracking
11. Greedy 
12. Intervals
13. Dynamic Porgramming

> Search Algorithms
1. Binary Search
2. Linear Search
3. Divide and Conquer

> Sort Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort

**There is no end to the depth and complexity in DSA. Don't get frustrated at first few tries. Cheers** ðŸ¥‚
