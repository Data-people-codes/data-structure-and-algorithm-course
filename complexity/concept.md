# Big O Notation
This is a representation of complexity of the code. This is also dependent upon the input. In `Big O`, there are six major types of complexities (time and space):

- Constant: O(1) --- Best
- Linear time: O(n) --- Fair
- Logarithmic time: O(n log n) --- Good
- Quadratic time: O(n^2) --- Bad
- Exponential time: O(2^n) --- Bad
- Factorial time: O(n!) --- Horrible


# Time complexity
Time required for a code to compile or produce output based on the input. It doesnt necessarily mean that the algorithm used, will be the fastest all the time in every scenario.


# Space Complexity
Memory or, storage space required for a code to compile, including the space of input values for execution. The best algorithm/program should have a low level of space complexity. The less space required, the faster it executes.
